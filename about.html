      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p data-start="516" data-end="964">I&rsquo;m Antonio, a proud New Mexico native from Clovis, currently living in San Antonio, Texas, with my wife Ashleigh and our dog, Florence. I work as a Public Affairs Specialist in the United States Air Force, where the ever-changing demands of the job have pushed me to adapt, problem-solve, and stay creative. Every day I am writing, shooting, or editing something new, and that constant motion has shaped the way I see stories out in the world.</p>
      <p data-start="966" data-end="1498">My work in public affairs is where my love for storytelling really took root. I move between photography, videography, graphic design, journalism, and public relations, trying to use each medium in a way that feels honest and useful. One day, I hope to take these skills and build something of my own that gives back to my family and my community, whether that is working in Public Affairs for the U.S. Forest Service or for an organization focused on uplifting marginalized communities through accurate and thoughtful storytelling.</p>
      <p data-start="1500" data-end="1807">Outside of work, I am passionate about my family, athletics, politics, the arts, anything outdoors, and menswear. Many of my favorite memories and photographs come from these spaces. I love being able to find new experiences with my wife, and in turn, I&rsquo;ve been inspired by the world she continues to show me.</p>
      <p data-start="1809" data-end="2140">Photography has become a way for me to slow down and make sense of everything moving around me. It allows me to hold on to experiences that would otherwise blur together with time. Whether I am documenting a protest, a trip into the mountains, or something simple at home, I am always drawn to moments that feel real and unguarded.</p>
      <p data-start="2142" data-end="2226">Thanks for taking the time to be here and look through my work. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
