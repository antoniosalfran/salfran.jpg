  <h3 data-start="241" data-end="269">University of New Mexico</h3>
  <p data-start="271" data-end="650">I began my academic journey at the University of New Mexico in 2015 on the main campus in Albuquerque, originally pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Exercise Science with a focus in Kinesiology. At the time, I believed a career in health or athletics was the direction I wanted to take. </p>
  <p data-start="652" data-end="1001">In 2019, I paused my education due to family challenges and returned home to support my loved ones. Stepping away from school was not an easy decision, but it ultimately helped clarify what mattered most to me and reshaped how I viewed my future. During this period, I realized I was drawn more toward storytelling and creativity than anything else.</p>
  <h3 data-start="1003" data-end="1039">United States Air Force &amp; DINFOS</h3>
  <p data-start="1041" data-end="1508">In 2021, I joined the United States Air Force as a Public Affairs Specialist and attended the Defense Information School shortly after. My training at DINFOS introduced me fully to media production, writing, photography, videography, social media management, and crisis communication. Working in a real-world communication environment every day sharpened my skills and showed me that storytelling was not just something I enjoyed, but something I was meant to pursue.</p>
  <h3 data-start="1510" data-end="1527">Return to UNM</h3>
  <p data-start="1529" data-end="1955">In the spring of 2024, I returned to the University of New Mexico and changed my major to Mass Communication and Journalism with a focus on Strategic Communication. This decision came from valuable experience in the field and the realization that communications is where I do my best work. Balancing university coursework with active-duty service strengthened my discipline and creativity in ways I could not have anticipated.</p>
  <p data-start="1957" data-end="2235">I will graduate with my Bachelor of Arts in Mass Communication and Journalism, Strategic Communication emphasis, on December 12, 2025. My education represents more than a degree. It reflects resilience, growth, and the courage to change direction when something better reveals itself.</p>
