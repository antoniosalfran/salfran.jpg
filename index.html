    <h2> I believe that when you photograph something, you are preserving it.</h2>

<p>
  Salfran.jpg Photography is a personal record of the places I move through and the people who matter most to me.
  I take photographs as a way of slowing time down and paying attention to small details that would otherwise pass
  without being noticed. Some of these images come from loud scenes in the street, others from quiet days at home,
  long drives across New Mexico, or conversations that linger longer than expected. No matter the setting, the goal
  stays the same: to hold on to something real before I lose it.</p>

<p>
  A lot of this work lives somewhere between documentation and personal journal. I am not interested in perfection
  or staged scenes. I am interested in the way light hits a person’s face when they are unaware of the camera,
  in body language during a protest, in the stillness of a landscape that seems unchanged for decades. Photography
  allows me to express myself and hold on to days that have passed.</p>

<p>
  I'd be happy if my photography could inspire one single person, if it could move someone in some way. When I see a photograph that strikes something within me, I find myself at peace in the world the photographer has allowed me to live in. So I hope you can find a feeling within these captured moments.</p>

<p>
  If you want to explore the work, start with the portfolio and move through it however you like. There is no
  right order and no single story. Just pieces of real life, collected and held together here.
